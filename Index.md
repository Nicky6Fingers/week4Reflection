# Week 4 Reflections

## Tailwind Podcast Reflection
Let me start off by saying that at first glance HTML/CSs seems "simple". You can easily get a simple static website going with the more simple HTML tags, and requireing no CSS. But depending on how deep you dig, the functionality of the things you can do grows greatly. and the power of the tools for instance in the podcast it mentioned formatting **ill get into this more later** using rems and ems you are able to scale your website much easier *IF* the website was made with this intiially in mind. And that is kind of the point i want to make, depending on your knowledge of certain things and if you created the website with these functions properly in the first place it makes things much easier to format and change. Without having to do it all again.
